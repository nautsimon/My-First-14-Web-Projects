# My-First-14-Web-Projects

**2019**
--------------------
[[RD Recicla](https://rdrecicla.com)]
I was hired to create RD Recicla to help people recycle in the dominican republic. There is a language toggle and custom google map. The google map api is no longer connected to a credit card so there is an overlay on the map.

[[Root Cellar Makerspace placeholder website](https://lucid-kare-8f5870.netlify.app)]
I created this placeholder for a makerspace founding group I was part of when I was in high school. Cool three.js animation.

[[BuildaBot Ghana](https://nifty-stallman-945b6b.netlify.app)]
A quick website I made for a project I ran in Ghana with my old nonprofit.

[[STEM-Dominica](https://sharp-hamilton-e9f332.netlify.app)]
A quick website I made for a couple projects in the Dominican Republic with my old nonprofit. 


**2018**
--------------------
[[Chrome productivity app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pesto-aioli/baalpccnhigkkjhdaacgbkfopdcpbemp)]
This was my first project in reactjs. A productivity chrome app that can record things to do and have hot links appear on each new page. I still use this today.

[[The CC](https://zen-bartik-72f3de.netlify.app)]
I created this website for my friend who was starting a SAT/ACT help newsletter. It is connected to an Spring Boot API served by AWS that I created.

[[Omnified’s website](https://relaxed-lewin-868bff.netlify.app)]
My LLC’s old website. 

[[ORION’s website](https://vigorous-almeida-6f9b9c.netlify.app)]
My nonprofit’s old website. 

[[Frederick Makerspace website](https://optimistic-shaw-ad03fc.netlify.app)]
I created this placeholder for a makerspace founding group I was part of when I was in high school. Cool three.js animation.



**2017**
--------------------
[[STEMDR First Iteration](http://simonmahns.github.io)] My very first website. Made with vanilla HTML and CSS. Also a reminder of my youth, as I created this by staying up all night without any caffine. The good old days.
