[[Class of 2023 clock](https://unruffled-mcclintock-886ffb.netlify.app)]

<br />This was my first project in ReactJs. A productivity Chrome app that has an interactive to-do list, the current date, and customizable hot links that appear every time that the user opens a new tab. The idea was that in order to prevent myself from getting distracted, everytime that I would open a new tab I would be forced to look at my to-do list. I still use this today.

**2017**

[[STEM-Dominica V1](http://simonmahns.github.io)]
